# Introduction

Remote attestation is a mechanism that allows a remote system (server) to verify the integrity of another system's platform (e.g., a Raspberry PiÂ®). In a Linux-based system, the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) can be used to capture platform measurements. Combined with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which provides hardware-based security and attestation features, this setup can authenticate and protect the IMA measurements, ensuring the integrity of the platform.
